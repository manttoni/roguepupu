TO-DO

- add t_player into t_game. t_player has all the players stuff
- write t_game to a file to save the game. t_game has to have all the info needed to start playing
- map file should have despawn/spawn point coordinates that are loaded to t_area or maybe t_cell
	####
	#  #
	## #
	####
	1;1;x;g // spawn a goblin at a spot that is x cells from 1,1. if x > 0 then randomize position
	2;2;1 // mark point 2,2 with index 1, for example it is a door leading outside, or simply player start
	...
	should this info be in a separate file?
